# DISCLAIMER
This isn't a official ArcoLinuxB ISO, it's my own fork. Follow the official links below for the official Isos, or try the mine. But if your personal porn computer with that system starts to send e-mails to your couple with compromised data, or you lose all your job's data, and try to take me responsability, I'll laugh at your face, and then try to help you, but I don't promise nothing

# ArcoLinux BYOI Plasma Bare desktop

That's my own spin of the Minimal Plasma edition of ArcoLinuxB. As I found the system full of metapackages, and I think it shouldn't have them, I forked the repository, and I started to modify it.

# Get your code and build your own iso
It's needed an ArcoLinux system (I think on Arch would work too, but maybe there are fails as Arco has more repos ;)

	git clone https://github.com/dus2002/ArcoLinuxB-Plasma-Bare-DUS.git
	cd ./ArcoLinuxB-Plasma-Bare-DUS/installation-scripts
	sudo bash ./30* (If first build) or ./40* (If you have built more ISO's)
	#That's only if you don't want to navigate to /root
	sudo mv -r /root/ArcoLinuxB-Out "your real home"/ArcoLinuxB-Out
	sudo chmod -R 777 "your real home"/ArcoLinuxB-Out

# Releases
I'll try to build releases every sunday. But if you don't have it, don't die. Maybe there is a problem with the repos...
